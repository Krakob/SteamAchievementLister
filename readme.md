# Steam achievements to Google Tasks list
Converts your clunky Steam achievements to text files usable in [Google Tasks Import](https://import-tasks.appspot.com/main).

## Requirements:
* [A Steam web API dev key](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). You can get it using any URL, it seems, so don't worry about needing your own domain or anything.
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/), a better HTTP module.
